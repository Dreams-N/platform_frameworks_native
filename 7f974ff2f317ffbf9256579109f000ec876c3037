i hadn't rebuilt the callers before because i was only interested in the failing app. when i try, GCC is unhappy about the ambiguous overload, even though this one is private.

only thing i can think of is to #ifdef around this and #define the guard on in the .cpp file so we can implement it, but not #define it anywhere else so that no client code sees it.
