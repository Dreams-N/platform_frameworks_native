We've been trying to standardize on 64_BIT in the make files instead of 64BIT.  Leaving BINDER_IPC_32BIT is probably fine, since nobody will have to manually specify that.

TARGET_ prefix is normally used to mean GCC build target (armv7, etc), maybe BOARD_KERNEL_USES_64_BIT_BINDER?

Colin - for multi-lib does the 2nd Arch pick up TARGET_IS_64_BIT ? If so we can use this flag here since both will be using the 64bit binder ABI,
