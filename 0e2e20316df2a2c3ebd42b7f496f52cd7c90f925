I think it might be good to have a few sentences about what errorCode means, relative to exceptionCode. that is, how one should interpret the errors. My understanding is that:

  1. ExceptionCode is the primary error code.
  2. If ExceptionCode is EX_NONE, no error occurred, and message and error code are nil.
  2. If ExceptionCode is other than EX_NONE, there will be a message.
  3. But if it is EX_TRANSACTION_FAILED, then the errorCode indicates the binder transaction error code, and there's no message.
  4. But if it is EX_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC, then the errorCode indicates the application-specific error code, and there is generally a message.

Is that correct?

Is this meant to be OK? Or just a 'no error code set' value?
If the former, might as well use OK.
