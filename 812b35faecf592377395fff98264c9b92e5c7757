While you're here, would it be possible to check the subdir argument, to make sure ".." isn't in the path? Otherwise, this could be used to delete files outside of the /data/dalvik-cache directory.

Is this actually used? SELinux would block the deletion of the /data/dalvik-cache/profiles directory, although it wouldn't block the deletion of the contents of that directory.

It's only needed when we're upgrading from a version of the system that didn't use ISA specific cache dirs. I.e all dex files are placed under /data/dalvik-cache.

Even in that scenario, we don't attempt to remove any directories under /data/dalvik-cache, just regular files. (See the change on line 1391)
