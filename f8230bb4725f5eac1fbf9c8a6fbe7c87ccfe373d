why not just omit the parameter name?

In general, if we saw the function was exported, or in this case, part of a JNI interface we didn't remove parameters even if we determined the function wasn't used anywhere as it would change binary interface. Since this is a JNI function can we even remove the 'env' and 'obj' parameters?

Oh. I see now I missed an important point in  your comment. You suggest to remove the parameter *name* to avoid the warning. Clang doesn't like this. All parameters must be named. I'd suspect just removing parameter names is a GNU extension.
