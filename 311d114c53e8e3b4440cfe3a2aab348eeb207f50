total nitpick, but: you generally have the init arguments as (code, msg), but this one is (msg, code). Any particular reason, or just happenstance?
Doesn't need fixing or anything, just happened to notice it.

I guess my thought here was that exceptions have 3 parts:
 1) exception type
 2) exception message
 3) exception subtype (only for service specific exceptions)

Since service specific exceptions already define the exception type, I just omitted that parameter, and left the other two pieces in the same order.

I guess I can see that this is an internal detail, and that for both the general and service specific exception, we're sort of picking an exception "type" (a more important concept than the message itself).


I'll change this to be errorCode first.
